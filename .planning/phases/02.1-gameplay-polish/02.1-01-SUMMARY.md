# Phase 2.1 Plan 01: Gameplay Polish Summary

**Stroke-outlined brand labels for mobile readability, brutal economy rebalance (-15 fake/-8 miss/+10 real), and localStorage best score with start/game-over display**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-07T14:02:32Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-07T14:05:08Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Brand names now clearly legible on mobile with white stroke outline (lineWidth 2.5, font 0.22x multiplier)
- Game economy rebalanced so casual play yields negative score; only careful name-reading earns positive
- Best score persists across sessions via localStorage with gold display on start screen and game over

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Enhance brand label readability** - `f77f91a` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Rebalance difficulty** - `cd4dfdd` (feat)
3. **Task 3: Add localStorage high score** - `acfb591` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `game.js` - All three changes: drawBrandLabel stroke outline, getDifficulty/spawnWatch/updateWatches economy rebalance, localStorage persistence + UI display

## Decisions Made
- [02.1-01]: White stroke outline (lineWidth 2.5) with 0.22x font multiplier for mobile brand readability
- [02.1-01]: Economy shift: real +10 (was +15), fake -15 (was -8), miss -8 (was -5), fakes 20-65% (was 15-55%)
- [02.1-01]: Single best score stored as JSON number in localStorage key 'watchNinja_bestScore'

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- All 3 pending todos from Phase 2 are now resolved (brand visibility, difficulty, high scores)
- Game is fully polished and ready for deployment (Phase 3)
- No blockers or concerns
