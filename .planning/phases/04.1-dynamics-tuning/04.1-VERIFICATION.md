# Phase 4.1: Dynamics Tuning Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Cards fly slowly enough that brand names are comfortably readable on mobile, with tuned launch speeds, arc heights, and rotation rates that balance readability with satisfying gameplay feel

**Verified:** 2026-02-08T14:15:00Z

**Status:** human_needed

**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| # | Truth | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | Brand names on cards are comfortably readable during flight on mobile -- player can distinguish Montignac from Montignak without squinting or lucky timing | ? NEEDS HUMAN | All supporting artifacts exist and are wired, but readability perception requires human testing on mobile device |
| 2 | Cards still feel satisfying to slash -- they have momentum, not floaty balloon motion | ? NEEDS HUMAN | Physics parameters implemented correctly, but subjective "feel" and "momentum" require human gameplay assessment |
| 3 | Difficulty ramp still works -- late-game spawns feel noticeably harder than early-game | ? NEEDS HUMAN | Speed multiplier (1.0x → 1.4x) and spawn interval (1.4s → 0.5s) implemented, but subjective difficulty perception requires human testing |

**Score:** 6/6 artifacts verified, but 3/3 truths require human verification

### Requirements Coverage

No requirements mapped to Phase 4.1 in REQUIREMENTS.md. Phase goal is standalone tuning work.

### Anti-Patterns Found

**None detected.**

- No TODO/FIXME/placeholder comments
- No stub patterns (return null, empty returns, console.log-only implementations)
- No old parameter values remain (GRAVITY = 600, 0.9 + 200, 1.0 + t * 0.8 all replaced)
- Rotation speed unchanged as specified (line 252: `(Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.5`)

### Human Verification Required

All automated structural checks passed. The following items require human testing to determine goal achievement:

#### 1. Early Game Brand Readability (Mobile)

**Test:** Play the first 15 seconds of a round on your mobile phone. Observe the cards as they fly.

**Expected:** Brand names (Montignac / fake variants like Montignak, Montinyac) are easy to read during flight. You can distinguish real from fake without squinting or waiting for lucky timing when the card is closer or slower.

**Why human:** Readability perception is subjective and depends on human visual acuity, screen size, lighting conditions, and individual reading speed. Cannot be measured programmatically.

#### 2. Late Game Brand Readability (Mobile)

**Test:** Play the last 15 seconds of a round (45-60s elapsed). Cards now fly at 1.4x speed with 0.5s spawn intervals.

**Expected:** Brand names are still distinguishable with effort. May be harder than early game but not impossible. You can still spot fakes under time pressure.

**Why human:** Late-game readability involves subjective assessment of difficulty scaling — the balance between "challenging but fair" vs "unreadable and frustrating" requires human judgment.

#### 3. Slash Feel & Momentum

**Test:** Slash multiple cards throughout a round. Pay attention to how the cards move through the air.

**Expected:** Cards feel launched with momentum — they have weight and inertia. They don't feel floaty, slow-motion, or balloon-like despite the reduced speed. Slashing them still feels satisfying and responsive.

**Why human:** "Feel" and "satisfying gameplay" are subjective qualities. Physics parameters are correct, but the perception of momentum and satisfaction cannot be verified programmatically.

#### 4. Difficulty Ramp Progression

**Test:** Play a full 60-second round from start to finish.

**Expected:** Late-game (last 15 seconds) feels noticeably harder than early-game (first 15 seconds). Difficulty should come from faster spawn rate (1.4s → 0.5s), increased speed (1.0x → 1.4x), and higher fake percentage (20% → 65%), not from unreadable cards.

**Why human:** Subjective difficulty perception requires full gameplay experience. The numerical ramp is correct, but whether it "feels harder" is a human judgment.

### Summary

**All 6 required artifacts exist, are substantive, and are correctly wired.**

- GRAVITY reduced from 600 to 400 (✓ applied to watches and split halves)
- baseVy reduced from `0.9 * canvasHeight + 200` to `0.65 * canvasHeight + 100` (✓ used in vy calculation)
- vy random spread reduced from 0.25 to 0.15 (✓ implemented)
- speedMultiplier capped at 1.4x instead of 1.8x (✓ wired from getDifficulty to spawnWatch)
- spawnInterval floor raised from 0.3s to 0.5s, start from 1.2s to 1.4s (✓ implemented)
- vx range reduced from 30-110 to 20-80 (✓ applied to both left/right spawns)
- Rotation speed unchanged (✓ verified at line 252)

**No anti-patterns detected.** Code is clean, no TODOs, no stubs, no old values remain.

**Goal achievement cannot be determined without human testing.** The structural implementation is correct, but the three success criteria are inherently subjective:

1. Are brand names "comfortably readable"? → Requires human eyes on mobile device
2. Do cards "feel satisfying to slash"? → Requires human gameplay perception
3. Does difficulty "feel harder"? → Requires human experience of progression

**Next Steps:**

1. Deploy to https://coupe-des-montres.jimmydore.fr (or test locally on mobile)
2. Complete the 4 human verification tests listed above
3. If approved: mark phase as passed
4. If issues found: identify specific parameters to adjust (too fast, too slow, too floaty, etc.) and create a gap-closure plan
