# Phase 4.1 Plan 01: Dynamics Tuning Summary

**Tuned 6 card flight physics parameters (gravity, velocity, speed ramp, spawn interval, vx, vy spread) for comfortable brand-name readability on mobile while preserving satisfying slash feel**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-08T13:58:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-08T14:00:06Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (1 auto + 1 human-verify checkpoint)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Reduced card launch velocity (baseVy from 0.9x to 0.65x canvas height) so arcs stay within visible screen
- Capped late-game speed multiplier at 1.4x (was 1.8x) to preserve brand readability at all difficulty levels
- Raised spawn interval floor from 0.3s to 0.5s to prevent screen overcrowding with slower cards
- Player confirmed brand names are comfortably readable on mobile

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Tune card flight physics parameters** - `89cb828` (perf)
2. **Task 2: Human verification checkpoint** - N/A (approved by user)

## Files Created/Modified
- `game.js` - Updated 6 physics constants: GRAVITY, baseVy, vy random range, vx range, speedMultiplier cap, spawnInterval floor/start

## Decisions Made
- Reduced GRAVITY proportionally with velocity (600->400) to maintain parabolic arc shape -- without this, reduced velocity would create a "popcorn" effect where cards barely rise
- Speed multiplier capped at 1.4x instead of 1.8x -- late-game difficulty now comes from faster spawns and higher fake percentage rather than raw card speed
- Spawn interval floor raised from 0.3s to 0.5s to prevent 4+ cards overlapping on screen with the slower flight speed

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Card flight physics are tuned and player-verified for readability
- Ready for Phase 5 (Sound Design) or Phase 6 (Buy/Sell) -- no blockers
- Blocker from 04-02 (card flight speed too fast) is now resolved
