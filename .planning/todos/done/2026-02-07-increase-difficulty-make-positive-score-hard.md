title: Increase difficulty - positive score should be a nightmare
area: general

## Problem

The game is way too easy — players can finish with a positive score without much challenge. The goal should be that finishing in positive feels like a real achievement. Current difficulty ramp (quadratic ease-in, spawn 1.2s->0.4s, speed 1x->1.4x, fake ratio 15%->55%) is too forgiving.

## Solution

TBD — possible levers: steeper difficulty curve, higher fake penalties, faster speed cap, more sneaky fakes earlier, shorter game duration, tighter spawn intervals, or combo-break penalties. Should feel frantic and hilarious, not frustrating.
