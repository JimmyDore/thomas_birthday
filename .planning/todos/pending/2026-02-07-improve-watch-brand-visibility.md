title: Improve watch brand name visibility
area: general

## Problem

The brand/name text drawn on watches (real "THOMAS" vs fake misspelled names) is not easily readable during gameplay. This is a core gameplay mechanic — players need to distinguish real from fake watches by reading the name, so poor visibility undermines the game's central joke and challenge.

## Solution

TBD — could involve larger font size, better contrast, bolder stroke, background behind text, or repositioning the label on the watch face.
