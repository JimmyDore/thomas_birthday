## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Stats:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 3min
- Total execution time: 22min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions from v1.0 (still relevant):
- [Roadmap]: Zero dependencies -- vanilla JS + Canvas 2D + nginx, no build tools
- [01-01]: DPR-aware canvas with explicit style sizing for guaranteed sharpness
- [01-01]: Pointer Events API for unified touch/mouse input
- [01-02]: Split halves reuse full drawWatch + clip rather than custom half-draw functions
- [02-01]: Quadratic ease-in (t*t) for difficulty ramp
- [02.1-01]: Economy: real +10, fake -15, miss -8, fakes 20-65%

New v1.1 decisions:
- [Milestone]: Vinted listing cards replace bare watch drawings for readability
- [Milestone]: Two-act gameplay (buy then sell) adds depth
- [Milestone]: Procedural Web Audio API sounds (no audio files)
- [Roadmap]: Cards first, sound second, buy/sell last (risk isolation)

### Pending Todos
